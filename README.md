# San Diego County regional map project

[TileMill](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/) map project for the regional base map used in multimedia experiences in the [San Diego Natural History Museum's Coast to Cactus exhibit](http://www.sdnhm.org/exhibitions/current-exhibitions/coast-to-cactus-in-southern-california/).

## Disclaimer
This code is offered here for example and reference. The compiled application is not intended for public consumption outside of the exhibit. This repository is lacking the media files that make up the full application.

## Technical highlights
We use this map to generate PNG maps from GIS data sources. These map images are incorporated into the map interactives in the exhibit.
